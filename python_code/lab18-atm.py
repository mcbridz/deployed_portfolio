# Lab 18: ATM
# Let's represent an ATM with a class containing two attributes: 
# a balance and an interest rate. A newly created account will 
# default to a balance of 0 and an interest rate of 0.1%. Implement 
# the initializer, as well as the following functions:

# balance() returns the account balance
# deposit(amount) deposits the given amount in the account
# check_withdrawal(amount) returns true if the withdrawn amount won't 
#   put the account in the negative
# withdraw(amount) withdraws the amount from the account and returns it
# calc_interest() returns the amount of interest calculated on the account

# Version 2
# Have the ATM maintain a list of transactions. Every time the user makes
#  a deposit or withdrawal, add a string to a list saying 
# 'user deposited $15' or 'user withdrew $15'. Add a new method 
# print_transactions() to your class for printing out the list of transactions.
