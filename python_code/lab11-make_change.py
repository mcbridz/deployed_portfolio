#Lab 11: Make Change

#Let's convert a dollar amount into a number of coins. The input will be the total 
# amount, the output will be the number of quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies. 
# Always break the total into the highest coin value first, resulting in the fewest 
# amount of coins. For this, you'll have to use floor division //, which throws away 
# the remainder. 10/3 is 3.333333, 10//3 is 3.

#Version 2 
# Instead of hard-coding the coins, store them in a list of tuples. This way you can make 
# custom coins.

#example output:
#Welcome to the Change Maker 5000 (tm)
# Enter a dollar amount: 1.36
# 5 quarters, 1 dime, and 1 penny
# Would you like make more change? yes
# Enter a dollar amount: 0.67
# 2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, 2 pennies
# Would you like make more change? no
# Have a good day!
