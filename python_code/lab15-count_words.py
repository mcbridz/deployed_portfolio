# Lab 15: Count Words
# Let's write a python module to analyze a given text file containing a book for
# its vocabulary frequency and display the most frequent words to the user in the 
# terminal. Remember there isn't any "perfect" way to identify a word in english 
# (acronymns, mr/ms, contractions, etc), try to find rules that work best.

# Find a book on Project Gutenberg and navigate to the plain-text version. You 
# can then send a request to that url using the requests library to get the text 
# into Python. You can also save the file into the same folder as the .py file 
# and open it using with.

# import requests
# response = requests.get('http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17192/pg17192.txt')
# print(response.text)
# We can also download a file of english words and place it next our .py file and 
# load it like so:

# with open('the_raven.txt', 'r') as file:
#     text = file.read()
# print(text)
# Take the following steps to build up our dictionary. The result should look 
# something like {'a': 3, 'the': 4}

# Make everything lowercase, strip punctuation, split into a list of words.
# Your dictionary will have words as keys and counts as values. If a word isn't 
# in your dictionary yet, add it with a count of 1. If it is, increment its count.
# Print the most frequent top 10 out with their counts. You can do that with the 
# code below.

# # word_dict is a dictionary where the key is the word and the value is the count

# words = list(word_dict.items()) # .items() returns a list of tuples
# words.sort(key=lambda tup: tup[1], reverse=True)  # sort largest to smallest, 
# based on count
# for i in range(min(10, len(words))):  # print the top 10 words, or all of them,
# whichever is smaller

#     print(words[i])

# Version 2 (optional)
# Count how often each unique pair of words is used, then print the top 10 most 
# common pairs with their counts.

# Version 3 (optional)
# Let the user enter a word, then show the words which most frequently follow it.
